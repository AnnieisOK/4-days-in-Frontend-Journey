# 4 days in Frontend Journey

The purpose of this project is to give some basic lines to the ones who want to have a start in Frontend Journey in **just 4 days**.

Each day will give the learner the opportunity to read and understand theoretical concepts and also to solve exercices to obtain a functional travelling blog. At the end, the user will be able to execute the CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update and Delete) on the articles, displayed as in the [provided design](doc/Day-1_HTML-CSS/Exercises/Design). 

The agenda has the following content:
- [Day 1 : HTML & CSS](doc/Day-1_HTML-CSS/Theory/README.md)
- [Day 2 : Basic JavaScript](doc/Day-2_Basic-JS/Theory/README.md)
- [Day 3 : More JavaScript](doc/Day-3_More-JS/Theory/README.md)
- [Day 4 : Angular](doc/Day-4_Angular/Theory/README.md)
